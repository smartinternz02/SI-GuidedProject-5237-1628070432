# E Library App
E Library App is a software that is used to maintain the record of the library. It contains work like the number of available books in the library, the number of books issued or returning or renewing a book or late fine charge record, etc. It helps to maintain a database that is useful to enter new books & record books borrowed by the members, with the respective submission dates. Moreover, it also reduces the manual record burden of the librarian.                          

This application will enable its users to get the information about different books that are available in the library and how many books the users currently have issued and the date of return etc. If the users didnâ€™t return the books on time, then it will calculate the amount fine and alert the user.
